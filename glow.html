      <h3>Skincare Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hydrate:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your skin plump and glowing. Use a hydrating serum or moisturizer after cleansing to lock in moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Sunscreen is non-negotiable:</strong> SPF protects your skin from harmful UV rays and prevents premature aging. Apply broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher every morning, even on cloudy days.</li>
        <li><strong>Double cleanse:</strong> If you're wearing makeup, try a two-step cleansing routineâ€”start with an oil-based cleanser followed by a gentle water-based cleanser to remove all impurities.</li>
        <li><strong>Exfoliate gently:</strong> Exfoliation removes dead skin cells and promotes skin renewal. Use a mild exfoliant 2-3 times a week to avoid irritation.</li>
        <li><strong>Night care:</strong> Nighttime is when your skin repairs itself. Consider using products with ingredients like retinol or peptides to support skin regeneration while you sleep.</li>
        <li><strong>Face masks:</strong> Treat your skin to a weekly nourishing face maskâ€”look for masks with ingredients like clay (for oily skin) or honey (for dry skin) to address specific concerns.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Targeted Skin Care</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>For Acne-Prone Skin:</strong> Try ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, and always opt for non-comedogenic products.</li>
        <li><strong>For Dry Skin:</strong> Choose hydrating ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin, and avoid products with alcohol or harsh chemicals.</li>
        <li><strong>Anti-Aging:</strong> Retinol is a great choice for reducing fine lines and wrinkles, but start slow to avoid irritation.</li>
        <li><strong>For Sensitive Skin:</strong> Stick to fragrance-free and soothing ingredients like aloe vera, chamomile, and calendula.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>DIY Skincare Recipes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Honey & Oatmeal Mask:</strong> Combine 1 tablespoon of honey and 2 tablespoons of ground oatmeal. Apply to the face for 10-15 minutes, then rinse off for smoother skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Coconut Oil Lip Scrub:</strong> Mix 1 teaspoon of coconut oil with 1 teaspoon of sugar. Gently scrub your lips to exfoliate and hydrate.</li>
        <li><strong>Aloe Vera & Green Tea Toner:</strong> Brew green tea and let it cool. Mix with 2 tablespoons of aloe vera juice. Use as a refreshing toner after cleansing.</li>

      <h3>Self-Care Habits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Take Breaks:</strong> In our fast-paced world, we often push ourselves to go nonstop. However, it's essential to step back, take a breath, and give your mind and body a chance to recharge. This doesn't have to mean taking long breaks; even a 5-minute pause to close your eyes and stretch can reset your energy. Aim to break up your work or study sessions every hour to refresh your focus and reduce burnout.</li>
        <li><strong>Breathe Deeply:</strong> Deep breathing helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system (the "rest and digest" system), reducing stress and anxiety. Take a few minutes throughout the day to practice deep breathing. Try the 4-7-8 technique: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds. Itâ€™s a simple way to instantly reduce tension and bring clarity to your mind. Try to incorporate breathing exercises before sleep for a more restful night.</li>
        <li><strong>Unplug:</strong> In a digital age, constant screen time can overwhelm the senses and disrupt mental health. Make a habit of unplugging at least once a day. Whether it's putting away your phone for an hour, taking a digital detox on the weekend, or establishing "no screen" times in the evening, unplugging allows you to reconnect with the present moment and recharge mentally. It also allows for more meaningful interactions and strengthens your connection to yourself and others.</li>
        <li><strong>Prioritize Sleep:</strong> Good sleep is the cornerstone of self-care. When youâ€™re well-rested, your body functions optimally, and your mind feels clear. Create a calming bedtime routine by dimming the lights an hour before sleep, using lavender or chamomile essential oils, or drinking a cup of herbal tea to unwind. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night and see how much more energized and productive you feel.</li>
        <li><strong>Move Your Body:</strong> Movement isnâ€™t just for fitnessâ€”itâ€™s a form of self-love. Whether itâ€™s stretching in the morning, dancing to your favorite song, or going for a walk in nature, moving your body increases endorphins, reduces stress, and improves overall well-being. Find a form of movement you love and make it a daily habit. Even a 10-minute session can elevate your mood and improve mental clarity.</li>
